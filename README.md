# CatchTheCat

A fun and interactive SwiftUI-based game where players catch cats within a set time limit.

## About the Project

CatchTheCat is a simple yet engaging game built using SwiftUI. The goal is to tap on the cat symbols that appear randomly on the screen within a limited time. The game currently includes:
- A **Classic Mode**, where players have 20 seconds to catch as many cats as they can.

Future updates will include new game modes and features like increasing difficulty levels and Firebase integration for score tracking.

## Features

- **Classic Mode**: Try to catch as many cats as possible within 20 seconds.
- **Upcoming Modes**:
  - **Progressive Mode**: Start easy, and increase difficulty as you meet the goals.
  - **Focus Mode**: Avoid tapping on the wrong symbols as you try to catch the cats.
- **Firebase Integration (Coming Soon)**: User login and score tracking via Firebase.
